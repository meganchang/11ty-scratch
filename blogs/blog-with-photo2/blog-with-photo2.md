There are about a million ways to write down your thoughts and share them with the world. But even with so many opportunities to do so, a very small percentage of people actually do it. As I write these sentences, I still hear a voice in my head saying “What gives you the right to? Who made you an expert? Why should anyone listen to you?”

Well, no one gave me the right, no one said told me I was an expert in anything, and no one told me anyone would listen to me. And it was within the last year or so that I realized the same was true for everyone who ever wrote and published in the history of the world. No one grants you permission, and no one needs to. Not having permission hasn’t stopped all the published authors, bloggers, poets, song writers before me, so why should it stop me?

Maybe this isn’t a problem for some people, but it is/was a huge problem for me. For a long time I thought “If I know something, I’m sure everyone else already knows,” or “Why would someone want to listen to me? Who am I to tell them?” I was also afraid of someone that someone disagreed with, or thought was “wrong.” It wasn’t until a few people told me something like “Thanks for explaining that, I totally get it now. You’re good at explaining things!” and “I didn’t know that! You should totally share that, it’s really helpful.” I started thinking about things differently. I wondered if I did have something to say that would be useful to someone.

You can’t find out without putting something out there, so here I am, putting it out there. Good luck, me!
